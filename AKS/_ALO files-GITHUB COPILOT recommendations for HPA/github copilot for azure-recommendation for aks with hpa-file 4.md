armandolopezo: @azure can you give an aks template or sample to test horizontal pod autoscaler?

Azure (Preview): To test the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can follow the [tutorial on scaling applications in AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-scale?wt.mc_id=knwlserAPI_inproduct_sdkextention#autoscale-pods). Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

1. **Define Resource Requests and Limits**: Ensure that all containers have defined CPU requests and limits. For example:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     requests:
       cpu: 1m
     limits:
       cpu: 1000m
   ```

2. **Create an Autoscaler Manifest File**: Define the autoscaler behavior and resource limits in a manifest file, such as `aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml`.

3. **Apply the Autoscaler Manifest**: Use the following command to apply the manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml
   ```

4. **Check Autoscaler Status**: Verify the status of the autoscaler using:
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa
   ```

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the [Azure documentation on autoscaling pods in AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-scale?wt.mc_id=knwlserAPI_inproduct_sdkextention#autoscale-pods).

armandolopezo: @azure where can i find the file aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml mentioned previously?

Azure (Preview): The `aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml` file is typically a custom YAML manifest file that you create to define the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for your application. You can create this file in your local development environment with the necessary configuration for your application. Here's an example of what the content might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

You can adjust the `name`, `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`, and `metrics` according to your application's requirements. Once you have created this file, you can apply it to your AKS cluster using the `kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml` command.

armandolopezo: @azure Can you show me an example of the aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml file?

armandolopezo: @azure How do I define resource requests and limits for my containers?

Azure (Preview): To define resource requests and limits for your containers in a Kubernetes deployment, you need to specify them in the container specification within your Pod or Deployment YAML file. Here's an example of how you can define CPU and memory requests and limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### Explanation:
- **requests**: This is the amount of CPU and memory that Kubernetes guarantees to the container. For example, `cpu: "250m"` means 250 milliCPU, which is 0.25 of a CPU core.
- **limits**: This is the maximum amount of CPU and memory that the container is allowed to use. If the container tries to exceed these limits, it may be throttled or terminated.

By setting these values, you help Kubernetes make better scheduling decisions and ensure that your application has the resources it needs to run efficiently.

armandolopezo: @azure How do I apply the aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml file to my AKS cluster?

Azure (Preview): To apply the `aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml` file to your AKS cluster, you can use the `kubectl apply` command. Here are the steps:

1. **Ensure you have the `kubectl` CLI installed**: You can download and install it from the [Kubernetes official site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

2. **Connect to your AKS cluster**: Use the Azure CLI to get the credentials for your AKS cluster:
   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-cluster-name>
   ```

3. **Apply the YAML file**: Run the following command to apply the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart-hpa.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify the HPA**: Check the status of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with:
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa
   ```

This will deploy the HPA configuration to your AKS cluster, allowing it to automatically scale the specified deployment based on the metrics defined in the YAML file.

armandolopezo: @azure How can I verify if the HPA is working correctly after applying the YAML file?

Azure (Preview): To verify if the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is working correctly after applying the YAML file, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check HPA Status**: Use the following command to get the status of the HPA:
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa
   ```
   This command will display the current status, including the number of replicas and the target metrics.

2. **Describe the HPA**: For more detailed information, use:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe hpa <hpa-name>
   ```
   Replace `<hpa-name>` with the name of your HPA. This will provide detailed information about the HPA's configuration, current metrics, and any events.

3. **Monitor Pod Scaling**: Check the number of pods in your deployment to see if they scale up or down based on the load:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   You should see the number of pods increase or decrease according to the metrics specified in the HPA.

4. **Generate Load**: If you want to test the scaling behavior, you can generate load on your application to see if the HPA scales the pods accordingly. You can use tools like `kubectl run` to create a load generator.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the HPA is functioning as expected and automatically scaling your application based on the defined metrics.

armandolopezo: @azure What metrics should I monitor to ensure the HPA is functioning properly?

Azure (Preview): To ensure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is functioning properly, you should monitor the following metrics:

- **CPU Utilization**: Check the average CPU utilization across the pods. This is a common metric used by HPA to scale pods up or down.

- **Memory Utilization**: Monitor the memory usage if your HPA is configured to scale based on memory metrics.

- **Replica Count**: Observe the number of pod replicas to ensure they are scaling according to the load and the defined HPA policies.

- **Custom Metrics**: If you have configured custom metrics, ensure they are being collected and reported correctly. This might include application-specific metrics like request count, latency, etc.

- **HPA Events**: Check for any events related to the HPA using `kubectl describe hpa <hpa-name>` to identify any issues or reasons for scaling decisions.

By monitoring these metrics, you can verify that the HPA is responding appropriately to changes in load and maintaining the desired performance levels for your application.

armandolopezo: @azure How do I troubleshoot issues if the HPA is not scaling as expected?

Azure (Preview): If the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is not scaling as expected, you can troubleshoot the issue by following these steps:

1. **Check HPA Events**: Use `kubectl describe hpa <hpa-name>` to view detailed information and events related to the HPA. Look for any warnings or errors that might indicate why scaling is not occurring.

2. **Verify Metrics Server**: Ensure that the Kubernetes Metrics Server is running and healthy, as HPA relies on it to retrieve resource metrics. You can check the status with:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
   ```

3. **Inspect Resource Requests and Limits**: Make sure that your pods have appropriate CPU and memory requests and limits defined. HPA requires these to calculate utilization percentages.

4. **Check Custom Metrics**: If using custom metrics, verify that they are being collected and reported correctly. Ensure that the metrics API is accessible and returning expected values.

5. **Review Logs**: Check the logs of the Metrics Server and any custom metrics adapters for errors or issues that might affect metric collection.

6. **Test Load**: Generate load on your application to see if the HPA responds. Ensure that the load is sufficient to trigger scaling based on the defined thresholds.

7. **Validate HPA Configuration**: Double-check the HPA configuration in your YAML file to ensure that the target metrics and thresholds are correctly set.

By systematically checking these areas, you can identify and resolve issues that might be preventing the HPA from scaling your application as expected.

armandolopezo: @azure What are common reasons for HPA not scaling?

Azure (Preview): Common reasons for the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) not scaling include:

- **Metrics Server Issues**: The Metrics Server might not be running or configured correctly, preventing HPA from retrieving necessary metrics.

- **Incorrect Resource Requests/Limits**: Pods may lack defined CPU or memory requests and limits, which are required for HPA to calculate utilization.

- **Custom Metrics Problems**: If using custom metrics, they might not be collected or reported correctly, affecting scaling decisions.

- **Thresholds Not Met**: The load on the application might not be sufficient to exceed the defined scaling thresholds.

- **Configuration Errors**: Errors in the HPA configuration, such as incorrect target metrics or thresholds, can prevent scaling.

- **API Access Issues**: HPA might not have access to the metrics API due to network or permission issues.

- **Pod Scheduling Constraints**: Resource constraints or node availability might prevent new pods from being scheduled even if HPA attempts to scale.

By addressing these common issues, you can improve the likelihood of HPA scaling as expected.

armandolopezo: @azure What are the best practices for setting resource requests and limits for my pods?

Azure (Preview): Here are some best practices for setting resource requests and limits for your pods in Kubernetes:

- **Understand Application Needs**: Analyze your application's resource usage patterns to determine appropriate CPU and memory requests and limits.

- **Set Requests for Guaranteed Resources**: Define resource requests to ensure that your application has the minimum resources it needs to function properly.

- **Set Limits to Prevent Resource Overuse**: Use limits to prevent a single pod from consuming too many resources, which could affect other applications.

- **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor resource usage and adjust requests and limits as needed to optimize performance and cost.

- **Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Combine resource requests and limits with HPA to automatically scale pods based on demand.

- **Avoid Overcommitting Resources**: Be cautious not to set requests and limits too high, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization.

- **Test Under Load**: Perform load testing to ensure that your resource settings are appropriate under different conditions.

By following these best practices, you can ensure efficient resource utilization and maintain application performance in your Kubernetes environment.

armandolopezo: @azure How can I monitor the performance of my pods to determine appropriate resource requests and limits?

Azure (Preview): To monitor the performance of your pods and determine appropriate resource requests and limits, you can use the following tools and techniques:

- **Kubernetes Metrics Server**: Deploy the Metrics Server to collect resource metrics like CPU and memory usage. Use `kubectl top pods` to view real-time metrics.

- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and use Grafana to visualize these metrics. This combination provides detailed insights into resource usage over time.

- **Azure Monitor for Containers**: If you're using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), enable Azure Monitor for Containers to collect and analyze performance metrics and logs.

- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Tools**: Use APM tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Dynatrace to monitor application-level metrics and gain insights into resource usage.

- **Custom Metrics**: Implement custom metrics for application-specific performance indicators and use them to inform resource settings.

- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to simulate different usage scenarios and observe how your application behaves under stress.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, you can gather the necessary data to make informed decisions about resource requests and limits for your pods.

armandolopezo: @azure  can you give an aks template or sample to test horizontal pod autoscaler with a basic app that consumes very low virtual machine resources?

Azure (Preview): Here's a simple example of an AKS deployment with a basic application and a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration. This setup uses a basic Nginx server, which consumes minimal resources, to demonstrate HPA functionality.

### Deployment YAML (`nginx-deployment.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "128Mi"
          limits:
            cpu: "200m"
            memory: "256Mi"
```

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler YAML (`nginx-hpa.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

### Steps to Deploy and Test

1. **Apply the Deployment**: Use `kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml` to deploy the Nginx server.

2. **Apply the HPA**: Use `kubectl apply -f nginx-hpa.yaml` to create the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

3. **Verify Deployment**: Check the status of the deployment and HPA using:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl get hpa
   ```

4. **Generate Load**: Optionally, generate load on the Nginx server to test the scaling behavior. You can use tools like Apache Benchmark (`ab`) or `kubectl run` to create a load generator.

This setup will allow you to observe how the HPA scales the Nginx pods based on CPU utilization. Adjust the resource requests, limits, and HPA configuration as needed to fit your testing requirements.

armandolopezo: @azure how can i test the previous app with apache jmeter?

Azure (Preview): To test the Nginx application deployed on AKS using Apache JMeter, follow these steps:

1. **Install Apache JMeter**: Download and install Apache JMeter from the [official website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi).

2. **Expose the Nginx Service**: Ensure your Nginx deployment is accessible. You can expose it using a LoadBalancer service:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: nginx-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - port: 80
       targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: nginx
   ```
   Apply this service with `kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml`.

3. **Get the External IP**: Once the service is running, get the external IP address:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service nginx-service
   ```

4. **Create a JMeter Test Plan**:
   - Open JMeter and create a new Test Plan.
   - Add a Thread Group to simulate multiple users.
   - Add an HTTP Request sampler to the Thread Group:
     - Set the Server Name or IP to the external IP of your Nginx service.
     - Set the Path to `/` (or any specific endpoint you want to test).
   - Add a Listener (e.g., View Results Tree) to visualize the test results.

5. **Configure Load**: In the Thread Group, set the number of threads (users), ramp-up period, and loop count to simulate the desired load.

6. **Run the Test**: Start the test by clicking the green start button. Monitor the results in the Listener to see how the application performs under load.

7. **Observe HPA Behavior**: While the test is running, use `kubectl get hpa` to observe how the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler adjusts the number of replicas based on the load.

By following these steps, you can effectively test the scalability of your Nginx application on AKS using Apache JMeter. Adjust the load parameters in JMeter to test different scenarios and observe the HPA's response.

armandolopezo: @azure Can you provide a basic JMeter test plan for the Nginx app?

Azure (Preview): Here's a basic Apache JMeter test plan setup for testing the Nginx application. You can create this test plan in JMeter to simulate load on your Nginx service.

### Steps to Create a Basic JMeter Test Plan

1. **Open JMeter**: Launch Apache JMeter on your machine.

2. **Add a Thread Group**:
   - Right-click on the Test Plan.
   - Select **Add** > **Threads (Users)** > **Thread Group**.
   - Configure the Thread Group:
     - **Number of Threads (users)**: Set to the number of concurrent users you want to simulate (e.g., 10).
     - **Ramp-Up Period (seconds)**: Set the time to start all users (e.g., 10 seconds).
     - **Loop Count**: Set to the number of times to execute the test (e.g., 5).

3. **Add an HTTP Request Sampler**:
   - Right-click on the Thread Group.
   - Select **Add** > **Sampler** > **HTTP Request**.
   - Configure the HTTP Request:
     - **Server Name or IP**: Enter the external IP of your Nginx service.
     - **Port Number**: Enter `80` (or the port your service is exposed on).
     - **Path**: Enter `/` (or any specific endpoint you want to test).

4. **Add a Listener**:
   - Right-click on the Thread Group.
   - Select **Add** > **Listener** > **View Results Tree**.
   - This will allow you to see the results of your test.

5. **Save the Test Plan**: Save your test plan with a `.jmx` extension.

6. **Run the Test**: Click the green start button to run the test and observe the results in the "View Results Tree" listener.

This basic test plan will simulate a specified number of users making HTTP requests to your Nginx application, allowing you to observe how it handles the load. Adjust the parameters in the Thread Group to test different load scenarios.

armandolopezo: @azure How can I test hpa with the suggested basic app from my home in aks I beleive I need ingress from previous apache jmeter tests. Can you give me ingress code to test hpa?

Azure (Preview): To expose your Nginx application in AKS using an Ingress resource, you'll need to set up an Ingress controller and create an Ingress resource. Here's a basic example of how you can configure an Ingress for your Nginx application:

### Step 1: Install an Ingress Controller

First, ensure you have an Ingress controller installed in your AKS cluster. You can use NGINX Ingress Controller as an example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

### Step 2: Create an Ingress Resource

Create an `nginx-ingress.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: <your-domain-or-ip>
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Explanation

- **host**: Replace `<your-domain-or-ip>` with your domain name or the external IP address of your AKS cluster.
- **service.name**: This should match the name of the service you created for your Nginx deployment (`nginx-service` in this case).
- **service.port.number**: The port on which your service is exposed (usually 80 for HTTP).

### Step 3: Apply the Ingress Resource

Apply the Ingress resource using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress.yaml
```

### Step 4: Test the Ingress

Once the Ingress is set up, you can access your Nginx application using the specified domain or IP address. You can then use Apache JMeter to test the application by pointing it to the domain or IP address configured in the Ingress resource.

This setup will allow you to test the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) by generating load through the Ingress, which routes traffic to your Nginx application. Adjust the domain or IP address as needed to match your environment.
