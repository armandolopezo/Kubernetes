### I will test SERVICE and INGRESS deployments from the following web page that
### I liked and I wanted to test to try to practice and learn AKS with the first
### lab tests to use Kubernetest with a sample web app with external access.
### the page of interest is:
### https://www.goglides.dev/roshan_thapa/deploy-a-application-on-azure-kubernetes-service-2hg0
### 
### The SERVICE and INGRESS deployments requires previous AKS cluster creation from the parent folder.
###
### I created this subfolder for "SERVICE and INGRESS" deployments tests because may be I will add other subfolders for
### TESTING DIFFERENT NETWORKING SOLUTIONS (for example, using AZURE PRIVATE DNS ZONES AND/or LOAD BALANCERS )
