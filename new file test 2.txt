Creating a file in the KUBERNETES folder in the local PC did not give me
COMMIT options in VS CODE but I open KUBERNETES folder (almost empty
before creating this file) in VS CODE associated with 
GITHUB REPOSITORY instead of open and creating a text file in
WINDOWS with explorer (instead of inside of visual studio code.)
